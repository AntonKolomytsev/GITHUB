# DAY 4
# Randomisation and Python Lists

## THEME 1 RANDOM MODULE
### Python contains RANDOM MODULE, that called import numbers for example from 1 to 10.
### Also we must create another file where we can create module and IMPORT this file into our main file for example
# module cities and after that we can call them with command name_file_where_we_write_module.name_of_module

## THEME 2 Lists
### Lists are data structure in python as integer, float, etc.
### Lists look as for example books = [book1, book2, book3]
### When we need find any value from list we use index [], for example books[1], true value will be book2
### If we need to find from the end of list we use negative index for example books[-2], true value will be book2
### counting started not from zero when you use negative index
### We can change any value in the list for example books[1] = bookA
### If we want add new value in the list we use method .append for example books.append(books4)
### If we want add some new value we use method .extend for example books.extend([books5, books6])



## THEME 3   INDEX ERRORS AND NESTED LISTS
# We can't print index that no into the lists. Error: list index out of range
# We can know length lists with command len(list) but it's show how much values in it list
